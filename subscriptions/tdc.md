# TDC (YouSee)

## Service Info
- **Website**: https://www.tdc.dk
- **Category**: Telecom
- **Typical price**: 149-399 kr/month
- **Billing**: Monthly

## Cancellation Path
1. Navigate to: https://mitprodukt.tdc.dk
2. **[USER ACTION]**: Log in with MitID
3. Navigate to: "Mine abonnementer" (My subscriptions)
4. Select the subscription you want to cancel
5. Click "Opsig abonnement" (Cancel subscription)
6. TDC will show your binding period end date and notice period -- review the dates
7. **[USER ACTION]**: Confirm cancellation
8. Save or screenshot the cancellation confirmation with the effective end date

### Alternative: Cancel by Phone
1. Call TDC customer service: 70 70 19 80
2. **[USER ACTION]**: Verify identity with the agent
3. Request cancellation of your subscription
4. The agent will attempt retention offers -- decline firmly (see Retention Tactics below)
5. Ask for written confirmation via email or SMS

## Retention Tactics
- TDC has an aggressive retention team -- expect to be transferred to a "specialist" who will offer discounts
- Common offers: 3-6 months at half price, free upgrade to a larger data plan, bundled TV/internet discount
- They may claim cancellation can only be done by phone even if you started online -- this is a stalling tactic
- Decline all offers clearly: "Nej tak, jeg vil gerne opsige" (No thanks, I want to cancel)
- If pushed, ask for a manager or repeat your request to cancel

## Quirks
- **Binding period**: Often 6 months on new subscriptions or after accepting a retention offer
- **Notice period**: 30 days from the end of the current billing period
- **Refund policy**: No refunds for partial months -- service continues until the notice period ends
- TDC and YouSee are the same company -- YouSee subscriptions are managed at https://www.yousee.dk/mit-yousee
- If you have bundled products (mobile + internet + TV), cancelling one may affect pricing on the others
- Number portability: You can transfer your number to a new provider -- request a "porteringskode" before cancelling
- Plans: TDC Mobilpakke Small (149 kr), Medium (249 kr), Large (299 kr), X-Large (399 kr) -- prices vary with promotions
