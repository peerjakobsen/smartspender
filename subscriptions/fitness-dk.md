- **Notice period**: 1 full calendar month from the end of the current billing cycle.
- **Refund policy**: No refunds for unused time. Membership remains active until the notice period ends.
- **Startup fee**: Oprettelsesgebyr of 100-300 kr is common and non-refundable.
- **Price tiers**: Basis (~199 kr), Flex (~269 kr), Premium (~349 kr). Flex memberships typically have no binding period but cost more per month.
- Email cancellation should always be accompanied by a request for written confirmation. Without confirmation, the membership may continue billing.
