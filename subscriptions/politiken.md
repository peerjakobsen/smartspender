## Retention Tactics
- May offer a heavily discounted rate (often 49-79 kr/month for 3 months) to stay
- May suggest switching to a cheaper plan (e.g. "Politiken Basis") instead of full cancellation
- Cancellation flow may highlight exclusive content and features you will lose access to
- Phone cancellation is more likely to trigger retention offers than the website
- Decline all offers firmly if the goal is to cancel

## Quirks
- **Binding period**: Intro offers (e.g. "3 months for 99 kr") often have a binding period for the promotional duration. After that, no binding.
- **Notice period**: None for monthly digital subscriptions -- access continues until end of current billing period.
- **Refund policy**: No refunds for partial months.
- **Intro pricing**: Very common. Typical pattern is 1-3 months at 49-99 kr, then auto-renewal at full price (149-199 kr/month). Check the original offer terms.
- **JP/Politikens Media group**: Politiken is part of JP/Politikens Hus. Your login may be shared across Politiken, Jyllands-Posten, and Ekstra Bladet. Cancelling one does not cancel the others.
- **Price tiers**: Digital Basis (~99 kr/month), Digital Plus (~149 kr/month), Digital Premium (~199 kr/month). Exact names and prices vary with current offerings.
