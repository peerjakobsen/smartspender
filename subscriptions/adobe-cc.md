# Adobe Creative Cloud

## Service Info
- **Website**: https://www.adobe.com
- **Category**: Software
- **Typical price**: 379-459 kr/month
- **Billing**: Both (annual plan billed monthly is most common, monthly plan also available)

## Cancellation Path
1. Navigate to: https://account.adobe.com/plans
2. **[USER ACTION]**: Log in to the service
3. Navigate to: Plans & Payment section
4. Find your Creative Cloud plan and click "Manage plan"
5. Click "Cancel your plan"
6. Adobe will ask for a cancellation reason -- select any reason and click "Continue"
7. Adobe may present a retention offer (discounted months) -- decline by clicking "No thanks"
8. Review the cancellation summary, noting any early termination fee
9. Click "Confirm"
10. **[USER ACTION]**: Confirm cancellation

## Retention Tactics
- Adobe frequently offers 2-3 months at a discounted rate (often 40-60% off) to keep you subscribed
- A second offer may appear after declining the first -- continue declining
- The cancellation summary screen emphasizes what apps and cloud storage you will lose access to
- Decline all offers and proceed to the confirmation step

## Quirks
- **Binding period**: Annual plans have a 12-month commitment even when billed monthly
- **Notice period**: None, but early cancellation of annual plans incurs a fee
- **Refund policy**: Early cancellation of an annual plan charges 50% of the remaining months as a termination fee
- **Early termination fee example**: If you cancel 6 months into an annual plan at 459 kr/month, the fee is approximately 6 x 459 x 0.50 = 1,377 kr
- Monthly plans (no commitment) cost significantly more (~729 kr/month for full suite) but can be cancelled without penalty
- Plans: Single App (~169 kr/month), Photography plan (~129 kr/month), All Apps (~379-459 kr/month annual, ~729 kr/month monthly)
- Cloud storage files are deleted 90 days after cancellation
