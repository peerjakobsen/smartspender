## Retention Tactics
- Apple shows current storage usage vs. the free 5 GB limit to discourage downgrading
- If usage exceeds the free tier, Apple warns that syncing will stop and some data may become inaccessible
- No discount offers or retention screens -- Apple relies on data dependency as the retention mechanism

## Quirks
- **Binding period**: None
- **Notice period**: None -- paid storage continues until end of current billing period
- **Refund policy**: No refunds for partial months
- Plans: 50 GB (~15 kr/month), 200 GB (~39 kr/month), 2 TB (~99 kr/month), 6 TB (~199 kr/month), 12 TB (~299 kr/month)
- iCloud+ features (Private Relay, Hide My Email, Custom Email Domain) are lost on downgrade
- Data is preserved for 30 days after downgrade; after that, files exceeding the 5 GB free tier may be deleted
- If using Family Sharing, the shared iCloud+ storage is removed for all family members on downgrade
- Photos and documents stored in iCloud remain on Apple's servers but stop syncing if over the free storage limit
