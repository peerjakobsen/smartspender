## Quirks
- **Binding period**: SATS memberships in Denmark often come with no binding period, but promotional deals may include a 3 or 6 month binding. Always verify on "Min Side" under membership details.
- **Notice period**: 1 full calendar month. Cancellation submitted mid-month means you pay for the following full month as well.
- **Refund policy**: No refunds for partial months or remaining time after cancellation is submitted.
- **Startup fee**: Oprettelsesgebyr of 200-400 kr depending on membership tier. Non-refundable.
- **Price tiers**: Online (~199 kr), Basis (~299 kr), Allround (~399 kr), Premium (~499 kr). Premium includes access to all SATS centers across the Nordics.
- SATS is a Nordic chain (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark). If you have a Nordic membership, cancellation applies across all countries.
- The app is the most reliable cancellation method as it provides immediate on-screen confirmation.
