## Cancellation via Number Portability
If you are switching to another provider, you do not need to cancel separately:

2. Provide your phone number and accept the porting agreement
3. The new provider handles the cancellation with Telia automatically
4. The transfer typically takes 1-2 business days

## Retention Tactics
- Telia may offer a discounted price or upgraded data package
- Common offers: 50% off for 3 months, free roaming add-on, bonus data
- They may highlight how long you have been a customer and offer a "loyalty discount"
- Decline clearly: "Nej tak, jeg vil gerne opsige" (No thanks, I want to cancel)

- **Refund policy**: No refunds for partial months -- service continues until the notice period ends
