## Retention Tactics
- Microsoft may offer a discounted renewal price or an extended trial period
- A summary screen lists all included apps and OneDrive storage to create urgency
- If you have a Family plan, it will remind you that shared members also lose access
- Decline all offers and proceed with the confirmation

## Quirks
- **Binding period**: None for monthly plans; annual plans commit for 12 months
- **Notice period**: None -- access continues until end of current billing period
- **Refund policy**: Full refund available if cancelled within 30 days of purchase or renewal; no partial refunds after 30 days
- Plans: Personal (~79 kr/month or ~799 kr/year), Family (~109 kr/month or ~1,099 kr/year, up to 6 users)
- Turning off auto-renewal keeps access until the period ends without charging again -- this is often easier than a full cancellation
- OneDrive storage reverts to the free 5 GB tier after cancellation; files are preserved but become read-only if over quota
- Office desktop apps switch to read-only mode after subscription expires
