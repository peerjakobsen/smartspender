## Retention Tactics

- May suggest a "pause" of membership instead of cancellation
- May highlight remaining benefits or unused personal training sessions
- Decline all offers firmly if the goal is to cancel

## Quirks
- **Binding period**: Many memberships have a 6 or 12 month binding period. You cannot cancel until the binding period expires. Check your original signup confirmation for the exact binding end date.
- **Notice period**: 1 full calendar month. If you cancel on 15 March, your last payment is April and access ends 30 April.
- **Refund policy**: No refunds for partial months or unused time within the binding period.
- **Startup fee**: Fitness World often charges a startup fee (oprettelsesgebyr) of 200-400 kr. This is non-refundable.
- **Price tiers**: Basic (~199 kr), Standard (~299 kr), Premium (~399 kr). Binding periods are more common on cheaper tiers with promotional pricing.
- Cancellation via the website is the fastest path. Phone cancellation may involve longer wait times and more aggressive retention attempts.
