## Retention Tactics
- Frequently offers a discounted rate (often 49-99 kr/month for 3 months) to retain subscribers
- May present a "pause" option (e.g. pause for 1-3 months) instead of cancellation
- Cancellation flow may show a comparison of what you lose vs. a cheaper plan
- Phone agents are trained to offer multiple retention deals -- be prepared to decline more than once
- Decline all offers firmly if the goal is to cancel

## Quirks
- **Binding period**: Intro offers typically bind you for the promotional period (e.g. 3 months). After the intro period, no binding on monthly subscriptions.
- **Notice period**: None for monthly digital subscriptions -- access continues until end of current billing period.
- **Refund policy**: No refunds for partial months.
- **Intro pricing**: Very aggressive. Common pattern is "first month for 1 kr" or "3 months for 99 kr" that auto-renews at full price (149-199 kr/month). Always check what the renewal price will be.
- **Berlingske Media group**: Berlingske is part of Berlingske Media. Your login may be shared across Berlingske, B.T., and Weekendavisen. Cancelling one does not cancel the others.
- **Price tiers**: Digital Basis (~99 kr/month), Digital Premium (~199 kr/month). Exact names and prices vary with current offerings.
- **Auto-renewal awareness**: The jump from intro price to full price is a common source of unexpected charges. If you signed up on a trial, set a reminder before the trial ends.
