## Retention Tactics
- Wolt may display a summary of how much you have saved on delivery fees to create regret
- May offer a discounted month (often 1 kr for the next month) to stay
- May suggest "pausing" the subscription instead of cancelling
- Decline all offers and proceed with cancellation

## Quirks
- **Binding period**: None
- **Notice period**: None -- access continues until end of current billing period
- **Refund policy**: No refunds for partial months
- **Free delivery minimum**: Wolt+ provides free delivery on orders above a minimum amount (typically 99-149 kr). Without Wolt+, standard delivery fees apply (typically 19-49 kr per order).
- **Price tiers**: Pricing varies and Wolt frequently adjusts. Common range is 49-79 kr/month. Check your account for your exact rate.
- Account and order history are preserved after cancellation. You can resubscribe at any time.
