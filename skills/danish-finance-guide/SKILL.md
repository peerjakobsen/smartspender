# Danish Personal Finance Guide

Based on "Privatøkonomisk rutediagram - Danmark v2025.2" by /u/Neovitami

## Overview

A structured 5-step approach to personal finance in Denmark:

| Step | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 0 | Budget | Reduce expenses, set realistic goals |
| 1 | Nødopsparing | Build emergency fund/buffer |
| 2 | Gæld | Pay off debt, save for necessary purchases |
| 3 | Pension | Secure pension and children's future |
| 4 | Formue | Save for other purposes |

---

## Step 0: Budget and Fundamentals

### Læg et Budget (Create a Budget)

An overview of expenses and income is fundamental for healthy personal finances.

### Essential Expenses Priority Order

Pay these FIRST, in order:

1. **Husleje/Huslån** — Rent or mortgage. Check if you qualify for boligstøtte (housing support).
2. **Mad** — Food. Save money by using offers, eating less takeout, cooking yourself.
3. **Essentielle regninger** — Essential bills: electricity (strøm), water (vand), heating (varme), etc.
4. **Indkomstafhængige udgifter** — Income-dependent expenses: transport, internet/phone if needed for work.

### Fritvalgsordning (Flex Benefits)

If employed with a flex benefits arrangement:
- You can choose between extra salary, freedom, or higher pension contributions
- If financially stressed, it may be advantageous to receive the money as salary
- Typical flex amount: 0.4–10% of salary

---

## Step 1: Emergency Fund (Nødopsparing)

### Initial Target

Build an emergency fund of the LARGER of:
- 1 month's living expenses, OR
- 10,000 kr

### Purpose

To avoid relying on credit for unexpected expenses:
- Car repairs (reparation på bil)
- Dental work (tandlæge)
- Medical expenses (medicin)
- Other unforeseen costs

### Where to Keep It

Use an **indlånskonto dækket af Indskydergarantifonden** (savings account covered by deposit guarantee).

### Expanded Target

After paying off high-interest debt, expand to **3–6 months of expenses** to cover potential job loss.

- The higher your expenses relative to income, the larger the buffer needed
- A-kasse members may want even more buffer

---

## Step 2: Debt Payoff Strategy

### Non-Essential Bills First

Before aggressive debt payoff, pay:
- Forsikringer (insurance)
- Fagforening (union dues)
- Internet
- Telefon

### Minimum Payments

**Always pay minimum payments on ALL loans** — missing minimums leads to extra fees.

### High-Interest Debt (Over 8% ÅOP)

Pay down aggressively. Two strategies:

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Debt Avalanche** | Pay highest interest rate first | Mathematically optimal, saves most money |
| **Debt Snowball** | Pay smallest balance first | Better motivation, quicker wins |

### Medium-Interest Debt (4–8% ÅOP)

After emergency fund is at 3–6 months, pay these off.

**Note**: Exclude realkreditlån (mortgage) from this calculation — mortgage debt is treated separately.

---

## Step 3: Pension and Long-term Security

### A-kasse (Unemployment Insurance)

Join an A-kasse to:
- Secure income if you become unemployed
- Contributions are tax-deductible

Consider:
- Which industry you work in (choose matching A-kasse)
- Your job security level
- If very secure, you might wait until nødopsparing is larger

### Aldersopsparing (Retirement Savings)

Start an aldersopsparing and **pay the maximum amount** (9,400 kr/year in 2025).

- Check first if you already have one through arbejdsgiverpension (employer pension)
- Optional if you don't want to self-manage pension savings

### Pension Contribution Target

Aim for **minimum 15% of gross salary** to pension schemes combined.

If not meeting 15%:
- Contact your pension company or bank
- Make an agreement to increase contributions

### Ratepension Notes

- Contributions are tax-deductible
- Can provide advantage if paying topskat (top tax)
- **Warning**: Very large ratepension can mean high taxes at payout in folkepension
- Payouts begin earliest 3/5 years before folkepensionsalder

### When Can You Access Pension?

Depends on when depot was created:
- **Before 1/1-2018**: Can start payouts 5 years before folkepensionsalder
- **After 1/1-2018**: 3 years before for aldersopsparing, varies for others

---

## Step 4: Children and Wealth Building

### Børneopsparing (Children's Savings)

- Maximum: 6,000 kr annually
- Total cap: 72,000 kr
- Tax-free growth
- Child must be 0–14 years old to open
- Binding period can extend from 18 to 21 years

### Financial Goals Before Retirement

Consider your priorities:
- Large trip or purchase
- Greater economic independence
- Larger savings for children
- Becoming debt-free (gældsfri)

### FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)

For those wanting to retire more than 3/5 years before folkepensionsalder:
- Invest in frie midler (free funds)
- Start with maksbeløb to aktiesparekonto
- Ratepension can only be paid out 3/5 years before pension age
